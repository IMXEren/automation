<p>The task to show all the <strong>Material You Colors</strong> in a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zwTAs1X.jpg">scene</a> with their <em>name</em> (eg. A1-100, N2-300) &amp; <em>hexcode</em> (eg. #000000, #FFFFFF). It can be called as a child task &amp; return the result <code>%colorcode</code> to the parent. Also, stuffed with the <strong>Hex Color Palette</strong> (<em>Top-Right in Activity</em>) but <em>unfortunately, unable to return them, rather copies &amp; write the hexcode on the focused element.</em><br>Demo <a href="https://i.imgur.com/qViwmGH.mp4">video</a></p>
